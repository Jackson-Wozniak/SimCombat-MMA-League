MMA League Overview (subject to change, has not been implemented as of this writing)
- 8 weight classes, each with 12 ranked fighters and up to a total of 20 non-ranked fighters
- Events are held weekly. Events have 10 fights, with a main and co main event
  - 4 fights per event involve at least 1 ranked fighter
  - Fights are simulated, this program exists solely through an API that updates automatically
  - Rankings are updated post event
  - Time starts based on the date the program is first run, but doesn't match real time
  - Events are held every 1-hour real time, equal to 1 week (each Saturday) in game
  - Event names start at 1 and follow from there ({League Name} 2, {League Name} 3...)
  - Fights are scheduled 4 weeks in advance, so a 4 week schedule always exists
  - Fights are chosen based on ELO within a weight class
- Fighters
  - Alongside rankings, fighters have an ELO score that allows for non-ranked fighters to fight those with ranks
  - This ELO is what decides the ranking behind the scenes
  - Each fighter has stats & attributes (details will be given later for these things)
  - Each fighter has a legacy score within their stats, so a leaderboard of the GOAT can be made
  - Legacy score will be updated with each fight. The primary way to receive this is to become champ and defend the belt
  - Fighters retire, which allows for an opening in the weight class
  - Fighters that dip below an ELO value will be kicked out, also allowing for opening in weight class
